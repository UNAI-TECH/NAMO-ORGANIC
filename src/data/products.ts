Industrial ghee separates cream directly from milk and clarifies it — skipping the fermentation step entirely. Bilona first ferments the milk into curd, which allows beneficial enzymes and probiotics to develop before churning. The resulting ghee carries a depth of flavour and a nutritional profile that industrial ghee cannot replicate. NAMO's A2 ghee is made only from the milk of indigenous desi cows — not crossbred — and the bilona process is maintained exactly as it has been for generations.",
